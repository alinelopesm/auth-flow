# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npx eslint .`

Verify all items lint

### `npx eslint --fix src`

This will try to automatically fix some problems with the files inside the src directory

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


# Creating a New Tag Guide

This guide outlines the necessary steps to create a new tag in the repository, merging the staging branch into main, creating the new release/tag, and communicating this update to the team.

### Step 1: Merge Staging into Main
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and are on the correct branch before performing the merge.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge staging

```

Resolve any conflicts that might arise during the merge process.

```bash
git push origin main

```

### Step 2: Create a New Release/Tag
To create a new tag, use the git tag command followed by the version number and a brief description of the changes since the last release.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Description of changes in version 1.0"

```
Push the created tag to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin v1.0

```
Make sure to replace v1.0 with the tag naming convention you are using.

### Step 3: Communicate with the Team
Informing the team about the new tag is crucial to keep everyone updated.
